# MazeSolverUI
Maze Solver implemented with WinForms UI (using C#, Managed C++/CLI and C++17)

This project has the Maze SOlver implemented using Win Forms as front end with a managed C++/CLI layer in between the front end and the core solver implemented in C++ 17 

A comprehensive test case instruction is recorded as video capture in power point which is also attached. Please refer to MazeChallengeSolver_compressed.pptx

The executable is TestCases/MazeChallenge.exe ( only on Windows)

Please invoke MazeChallenge.exe to run the test cases by loading the files (unit test cases) such as 
TestCases\maze_01_given_sample.txt
maze_02_2_connected_components.txt
maze_03_with_cycles_redundancies.txt
maze_04_loop_equal_weights_ASTAR.txt
